    <h2>ASP.NET Web Reporting Sample</h2>
    This sample project demonstrates<br />
    <ul>
        <li>the <b>Html5Viewer</b> component that allows viewing of and interacting with a report in the browser,</li>
        <li>the <b>Web Designer</b> component which may be used to design reports on a server with a redistributable and lightweight Web Designer for the installation on client computers, and</li>
        <li>how a <b>File Repository</b> can make List &amp; Label much easier to use in a distributed web application.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>File Repository Support</h4>
    When List &amp; Label is used in web applications, it is recommended to use a repository to manage the files of a report (e.g. project files, images, PDF files, drilldown projects, ...).<br />
    A repository is a container for all required files of a report. Each item in the repository has a unique ID and is accessed via a stream-based API.<br />
    Implementing a custom repository for List &amp; Label provides several advantages for web applications:<br />
    <ul>
        <li>There are no local file paths in your reports that could fail when a project is designed on a client computer but printed on the server (even no relative paths).</li>
        <li>The Web Designer automatically uploads and manages all files used in a project.</li>
        <li>You can freely choose where to store the files of a report, whether it`s a SQL database, a webservice, a ZIP archive, ...</li>
        <li>If the repository items are stored in a central location like a SQL database, you can easily synchronize all your projects between any number of applications that use List &amp; Label.</li>
    </ul>
    The demo repository in this sample (SQLiteFileRepository.vb) shows how to implement a repository that uses a SQLite database to load and save all the available demo reports.
