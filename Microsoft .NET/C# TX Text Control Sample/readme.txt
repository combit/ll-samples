This sample requires the component 'TX Text Control .NET' from Text Control GmbH - at least in version 22.0 and Edition > Express. Additional information about this 3rd party component can be found under https://www.textcontrol.com/. combit does not offer support for this component.

This sample code is provided "as is" and can be modified or extended according to your own requirements. As TX Text Control is using flow text and List & Label uses paged based layouts, the TX Text Control object cannot support all RTF stream features.

Known limitation(s):
- RTF documents with tables including large cell contents exceeding the table's height are not rendered completely. These table lines might be missing content or are truncated.
